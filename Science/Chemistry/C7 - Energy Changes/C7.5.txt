C7.5 Chemical cells and batteries
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in a circuit the electrons will always flow from the more reactive electrode to the less reactive electrode

if one electrode is zinc
and the other is copper

the zinc will lose electrons ans Transfer to the copper

Zn + CuSO4 --> ZnSO4 + Cu

Zn --> Zn2+ + 2e-
Cu2+ + 2e- --> Cu

The greater the difference in reactivity between two metals used, the higher the voltage
