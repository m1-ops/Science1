C7.4 Bond energy calculations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED PRACTICAL 4: TEMPERATURE CHANGE
-----------------------------------------
Dependent variable - Temperature change
Independent variable - volume of sodium hydroxide
Control variable - Concentration of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid

1) Measure 30cm^3 of dilute hydrochloric acid
2) Transfer acid to polystyrene cup
3) Stand polystyrene cup in beaker
    -Stops from falling over
4) Use thermometer to measure acid temp.
    -Record in a table
5) Measure 5cm^3 of sodium hydroxide solution
6) Transfer to polystyrene cup
7) Place plastic lid on top
    -Has a hole in it
8) Place thermometer in the hole
    -Bulb of thermometer must be inside solution
    -Use thermometer to stir solution
9) Record the highest temperature reached
10) Rinse and dry the polystyrene cup
11) Repeat experiment 3x and calculate the mean
12) Repeat experiment using 10cm^3 of sodium hydroxide solution
13) Record results in graph


in an exothermic reaction, the energy released from forming new bonds must be negative
in an endothermic reaction, the energy taken in from breaking bonds must be positive
