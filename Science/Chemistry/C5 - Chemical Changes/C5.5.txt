C5.5 Salts for Insoluble Bases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metal oxide + acid --> salt + water
Metal hydroxide + acid --> salt + water

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASE = Substances that neutralse acids eg. metal oxides
ALKALI = Bases that are soluble eg. metal hydroxide (when in water, forms OH-)

All alkalis are bases but not all bases are alkalis

  CRYSTALISATION
1) Place some sulfuric acid in a beaker and warm it on a tripod
2) Add a spatula of copper(II) oxide powder to the acid and stir with a glass rod
3) Continue adding copper(II) oxide powder until it is in excess. Excess will be seen
4) Filter the mixture to remove excess
5) Pour the filtrate into an evaporating basement
6) Heat the copper sulfate solution until crystals appear on the edge
7) Remove the basin from the heat and allow to dry
8) Remove any water leftover by patting with filter paper
