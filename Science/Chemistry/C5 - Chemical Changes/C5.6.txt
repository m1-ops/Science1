C5.6 Making more Salts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ACID + ALKALI --> SALT + WATER

H+ + OH- --> H2O

ACID + AMMONIA SOLUTION --> AMMONIUM SALT + WATER

ACID + CARBONATE --> SALT + WATER + CARBON DIOXIDE

Titration
---------
1) Use a pipette to transfer 25cm^3 of sodium hydroxide solution into a flask
2) Add 5 drops of indicator such as menthl orange to the alkali in the conical flask
3) Place the conical flask into on a white tile so we can see the color change more clearly
4) Fill a burette with sulfuric acid
5) Add acid to the alkali until the solution is neutral. we need to add just enough for this to happen
6) Once we start to see a color change, we now add the acid drop by drop until the solution is neutral
7) It is important to swirl the solution to make sure the acid and alkali mix
8) Read the volume of acid added from the burette under the muniscus
9) Repeat experiment 3x
10) Calculate the mean
