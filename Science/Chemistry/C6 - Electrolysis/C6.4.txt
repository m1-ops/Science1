C6.4 Electrolysis of aqueous solutions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANODE - if there is halide ions, the halogen forms, if there is not then oxygen forms
CATHODE - Hydrogen is produced if the metal is more reactive than hydrogen, if not then the metal is formed

Required practical: Electrolysis
--------------------------------
1) Pour approx 50cm^3 of copper (II) chloride solution into a beaker
2) Place a plastic petri dish over the beaker
    -petri dish has two holes
3) Insert carbon graphite rod into each hole
    -These are electrons
    -They are unreative
    -Do not touch them together
4) Attach crocodile leads to the rods
    -Connect to a low voltage power supply
5) Select 4v on the power supply
6) Observe the 2 electrodes
7) Copper will form at the cathode. Chlorine will form at the anode
8) To test for chlorine hold blue litmus paper near the anode and it should become bleached
