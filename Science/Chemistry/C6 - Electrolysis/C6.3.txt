C6.3 The extraction of aluminium
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bauxite
  (purified)
Aluminium oxide
  (Electrolised)
Aluminium metal

Aluminium is mixed with cryolite which lowers the melting point

ELECTRODES MUST BE MADE FROM GRAPHITE
  - High melting
  - Unreactive
  - Extremely conductive

At the Cathode:
      Al3+ + 3e- --> Al
At the Anode:
      2O2- --> O2 + 4e-
